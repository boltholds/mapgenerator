This is a small utility that I wrote to simplify the creation of a Python executable file for the company's framework from a table with a specification.I did it as a training session since it contains working with tables, recursive vocabulary and regular expressions
It has both a CLI interface in the mapper module and a GUI for file selection, and it is also possible to export to JSON format.
